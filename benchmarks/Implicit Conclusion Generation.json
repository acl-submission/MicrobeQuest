Extract only the names of such stimulatory agents:\n   - Chemical compounds (e.g., sodium selenite), elements (e.g., iron), complex additives (e.g., yeast extract), vitamins (e.g., B12), and gases if described as stimulatory (e.g., H₂).\n4. Do not include:\n   - Basic carbon/energy sources, standard media components, or trace mixes unless a specific active compound is identified.\n5. Output Format:\n   - Use `\"compound name (1)\"` if no dosage is specified.\n   - Use `\"compound name (1) (concentration)\"` if dosage is specified.\n   - Comma-separated list format.\n   - Examples:\n     - `\"yeast extract (1) (0.1%)\"`\n     - `\"selenite (1) (100 nM), iron (1) (10 μM), vitamin B12 (1) (20 μg/L)\"`\n     - `\"iron (1) (5–10 μM)\"`\n6.
