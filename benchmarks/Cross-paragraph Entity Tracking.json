Classify the organism’s growth environment using the following predefined categories:\n   - Reactors\n   - Intestinal tracts\n   - Soil\n   - Water/sediments\n   - Symbiosis with host\n   - Geothermal\n   - Subsurface\n   - Plants\n   - Oil and gas field\n\n2. Only include environments where **growth is explicitly described**, not just isolation.\n\n3. Use phrases such as:\n   - “grows in”, “thrives in”, “inhabits”, “colonizes”, “commonly found growing in”\n\n4. If only the isolation site is mentioned **without confirming growth**, use the isolation source as a proxy to assign the best-matching category.\n\n5. If no matching environment or category is found, return: **\"not provided\"**\n\n6. Final output must consist only of the standardized category names listed above (exact spelling and casing).\n",

Look for phrases like:\n   - “required for growth”, “essential component”, “cannot grow without vitamins”, etc.\n   - Experimental descriptions showing no growth without the component and restored growth when added.\n\nStep 2 – Convert to boolean output:\n1. If vitamins are explicitly required → return `true`\n2. If not essential or not mentioned → return `false`\n\nOutput Format:\n- Return either `true` or `false`\n",
