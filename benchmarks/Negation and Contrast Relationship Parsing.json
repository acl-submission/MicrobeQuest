Include concentration when available:\n- Format: `agent (1) (concentration)`\n- If range is provided, use full range (e.g., `NaCl (1) (0.5–1.0 M)`).\n4. Do not include:\n- Agents causing only growth inhibition without membrane disruption.\n5. Output Format:\n- Comma-separated list in the form: `agent (1) (concentration)`\n- If concentration not provided: `agent (1)`\n6. If no chemical lysis agents are mentioned → `\"not provided\"`\n",
