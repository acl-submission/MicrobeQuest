Include any descriptions of growth on different media if provided.\n5. Note any changes in appearance over time or under different conditions.\n6. Include any microscopic observations of colony structure.\n7. If motility is mentioned, include this information.\n8. If no morphological information is found, answer 'not provided'.\n9.

If no length information is found → return `\"not provided\"`\n\nOutput Format:\n- Return a **number only**, in micrometers, with **one decimal place if needed**\n- Examples: `8.0`, `7.0`, or `\"not provided\"`\n",
